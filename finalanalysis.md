## Why did this cipher stop being useful?
### The cipher became too easy to break because of brute force attacks.

## What made it useful?
### The Four-square cipher encrypts pairs of letters, which makes it significantly stronger than substitution ciphers etc. since frequency analysis becomes much more difficult.

## What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?
### One intresting code that i found that was simaler to four square is two square cipher. It is bascilly the same thing just with two squares.
