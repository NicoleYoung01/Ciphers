## How many possible keys or codes could there be?
* There are 2 keys (keywords) that are used in the ciphertext squares. 
* There are 676 possible digraphs

## How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key
* If you knew the plaintext and ciphertext then you would just do the reverse of what you would do when you encrypt it to decrypt it. 
* If you only knew the ciphertext then you would have to use brute force cryptanalysis to search for matches between pairs of letters and the known frequency of occurrence of the pair of letters in the language.

## What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
